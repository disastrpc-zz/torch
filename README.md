# Torch
## A simple Minecraft server wrapper written in Go

## Dear god why?
This project started after I failed to find a good reliable server restart mod available for the latest versions of Minecraft, and since most plugin APIs are still not updated, that route was also closed. I first attempted to write a script using Python, however the speed at which the server wrote to stdout was too much for it to handle and issues started arising, so I did what any sane person would do and started learning Go for its great concurrency and speed.
